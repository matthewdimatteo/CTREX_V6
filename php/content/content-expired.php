content-expired.php
By Matthew DiMatteo, Children's Technology Review

This file is now obsolete
It was originally intended to serve as the content file for a page 'expired.php' that a user sees after a login attempt that failed due to an expired subscription

The current method for handling the above case is redirecting the user to the page where the login form was submitted (using login-process.php)
and displaying an error message using $_SESSION storage
