php/search-form-experts.php
By Matthew DiMatteo, Children's Technology Review

This file contains a search form for the experts page
Currently, the pool of expert reviewers is small enough that searching is not neccessary
Should it grow, or if expert data must be sorted, this form may be used

Refer to 'experts.php' to set the $searchType to either 'reviews' or 'experts' and the $pageType to either 'content' or 'search'
